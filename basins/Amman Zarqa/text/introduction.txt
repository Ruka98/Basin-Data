The Amman Zarqa basin covers approximately an area of 4,100 km2, with a large portion (over 93% of the basin) located in Jordan and 7% in Syria (Figure 1). A large portion of Jordan’s population are dependent on the various agricultural and industrial activities that the basin supports. The outflow of the basin serves as irrigation water source for the greater Jordan Valley (Al-Omari et al., 2013; Amdar et al., 2024; Hammouri & El-Naqa, 2007).
