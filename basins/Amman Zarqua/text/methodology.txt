The methodology follows the standard WA+ framework (http://www.wateraccounting.org).
Remote sensing data is used to estimate Precipitation (P) and Evapotranspiration (ET).
Land use data is derived from global datasets and refined with local information.
The water balance is computed on a monthly basis and aggregated annually.
